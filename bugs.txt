This is a running log of the bugs I've found either directly using this tool, or in the development of the tool. The idea is that it will help me to evaluate whether writing this tester was an efficient use of my time.

Bug 1
=====

LP: #1783940 - https://bugs.launchpad.net/netplan/+bug/1783940
Fixed in my tree

For route types, only 'prohibit' is accepted in YAML, but the docs say that 'prohibited' is the correct form.

Bug 2
=====

LP: #1786726 - https://bugs.launchpad.net/netplan/+bug/1786726
Fixed in my tree

In an IPv6 static setup with NetworkManager, such as the following:

    ens8:
      accept-ra: false
      addresses: ['23:b0:87:58:65:f7:fb:8b/45', '63:94:73:e1:46:15:79:58/50']
      nameservers:
        addresses: ['f2:9d:bc:04:7b:87:ec:28']
        search: [lab, home]
      renderer: NetworkManager

we see the following error in syslog: 

NetworkManager[19666]: <warn>  [1532665946.1502] keyfile: error loading connection from file /run/NetworkManager/system-connections/net
plan-ens8: invalid connection: ipv4.dns-search: this property is not allowed for 'method=link-local'

netplan renders an ipv4 dns search property, even though there is no configured ipv4 address. NetworkManager doesn't like this and it prevents the connection from being configured.


Bug 3
=====

Fixed in my tree.

netplan should warn/error if you attempt to render a route that NetworkManager does not understand.

NetworkManager is only able to understand routes of the form route/plen,gateway,metric - *nothing* else is recognised. (per https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/nm-settings-keyfile.html) Netplan does not verify that routes for a NM connection only specify these things. Because netplan can specify blackhole and prohibit routes, this can go horribly wrong.

Bug 4
=====

netplan should warn/error if you attempt to add another route to default on a NetworkManager connection. NM appears not to understand default routes - if you specify 0.0.0.0/0, a warning is printed in syslog and NM interprets it as 0.0.0.0/24.

Arguably this is terrible NM behaviour and an NM bug, but it should be warned about and/or reported to them.

Bug 5
=====

Fixed in my tree.

An unspecified gateway leads to "Gateway: (null)" being rendered.

network:
  ethernets:
    ens11:
      addresses: [148.225.107.152/26]
      routes:
      - to: 212.104.150.167/31
        type: prohibit
  version: 2

when rendered, leads to:

cat /run/systemd/network/10-netplan-ens11.network 
[Match]
Name=ens11

[Network]
Address=148.225.107.152/26

[Route]
Destination=212.104.150.167/31
Gateway=(null)
Type=prohibit

Bug 6
=====

Fixed in my tree.

Netplan renders the source of a route as "From=", it should be "PreferredSource=".

This leads to the following messages in syslog:

systemd-networkd[28645]: /run/systemd/network/10-netplan-ens7.network:14: Unknown lvalue 'From' in section 'Route'

Bug 7
=====

IP addresses with trailing garbage are not rejected.

This route:

      routes:
      - from: 152.168.36.126/19
        metric: 63668
        scope: host
        table: 11879
        to: 0.0.0.0/0,
        via: '129.196.75.179'

Becomes

[Route]
Destination=0.0.0.0/0,
...

leading to
systemd-networkd[28645]: /run/systemd/network/10-netplan-ens7.network:12: Route Destination= prefix is invalid, ignoring assignment: 0.0.0.0/0,


Bug 8
=====

Scope link and scope host routes cannot have a gateway: they are for things on the next hop and on the system respectively.

If you specify a via, you get the route failing to apply and an Invalid argument in syslog.
If you do not specify a via, you get 'Error in network definition //etc/netplan/fuzz.yaml line 5 column 6: unicast route must include both a 'to' and 'via' IP'

Example:
      routes:
      - {scope: host, to: '173.64.0.0/12'}

# ip route add 172.64.0.0/12 scope host dev ens10
succeeds, but
# ip route add 172.64.0.0/12 scope host dev ens10 via 1.2.3.4
Error: Route with host scope can not have a gateway.

Bug 9
=====

netplan should not permit a prohibit/unreachable/blackhole route to specify a gateway.
Otherwise it will not be applied by networkd.

Bug 10
======

In a route, 'from' needs to take an address not an address + netmask; otherwise networkd won't render it.

Currently no validation is done at all except for checking if it's a recognised family, which means things like
'10.0.0.1/80' get through

Bug 11
======

table should be mandatory for routing policy - there needs to be an action

man ip rule is pretty clear:

ip rule { add | del } SELECTOR ACTION
SELECTOR contains (from, to, tos, fwmark)
ACTION contains table and other stuff we don't support

AIUI you need to say what the rule should *do*, and there's no other way to do that
in the schema than a table.

Bug 12
======

There should be an error/warning if you try to specify routing-policy for NM.

Bug 13?
=======

Nothing stopping invalidly high tables in routing policy.
(what is too high? seems things >= 36727 are unreliable)

Bug 14
======

netplan requires that a route policy must include a from or to IP.
But this is not a requirement - this is valid:
ip rule add tos 8 table 12345

this requirement should be dropped

Query
=====

ip rules are not interface specific (modulo iif and oif which we don't seem to set)
This is also true of various route types and the host scope. Do they need a top-level
block?

systemd bugs to be worked around
================================

#5882
-----

https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/5882

PreferredSource= does not work on IPv6, it would seem.

Other Irritations
=================

Bug nm01: so, umm, NM gives you ~no~ useful info if v6 routes is misconfigured; everything rolls on fine :(
Bug nd01: likewise, no feedback at all if a route cannot be added; everything just rolls on

unconfirmed bug - I bet prohibit/etc routes will not be un-try-ed properly as they are _tricky_ to tear down.
